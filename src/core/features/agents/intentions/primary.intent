# Primary Intention: q:agent

## What the user wants to accomplish
The user wants an AI agent to autonomously complete complex, multi-step tasks by using available tools (functions, queries, APIs).

## User's mental model
"I want to give AI a goal and let it figure out the steps, using the tools I provide."

## Natural language expressions
- "Create an agent that can help customers with their orders"
- "Build an agent to analyze sales data and generate insights"
- "Make an AI assistant that can look up information and take actions"
- "Let the agent decide which tools to use to solve this problem"

## Core user needs
1. Define autonomous agents with clear instructions
2. Give agents access to tools (functions, queries, APIs)
3. Execute agents with specific tasks
4. See what actions the agent took and why
5. Get structured results with action logs
6. Set safety limits (max iterations, timeout)

## Expected outcomes
- Agent completes the task autonomously
- Agent uses appropriate tools in correct order
- User sees final answer plus action log
- Errors are handled gracefully
- Agent doesn't exceed iteration or time limits

## Emotional context
- Users want **automation** - agents handle complex workflows
- Users want **transparency** - see what agent did
- Users want **control** - explicit tool permissions
- Users feel **empowered** when agents augment their applications

## Success criteria
- Agent can reason about which tools to use
- Tools are called correctly with proper arguments
- Agent synthesizes results into coherent response
- Action log shows all tool calls
- Safety limits prevent runaway execution
