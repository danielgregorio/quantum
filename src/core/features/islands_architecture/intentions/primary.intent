intention:
  name: "Islands Architecture - Client-Side Reactivity"
  version: "1.0.0"
  category: "reactivity"
  goal: |
    Enable islands of client-side reactivity with q:state, event handlers,
    two-way binding, and component hydration. Full SPA experience where
    needed, static HTML where possible for optimal performance.

  planned_features:
    - "q:state name='...' value='...' - Reactive state"
    - "q:click='handler' - Click event handler"
    - "q:change='handler' - Change event handler"
    - "q:input='handler' - Input event handler"
    - "q:model='variable' - Two-way data binding"
    - "q:show='{condition}' - Client-side conditional display"
    - "interactive='true' - Mark component for hydration"
    - "JavaScript bundling and code splitting"
    - "Virtual DOM for efficient updates"

  architecture:
    - "Server-side render initial HTML"
    - "Ship minimal JavaScript for interactive components"
    - "Hydrate components on client"
    - "Reactive state updates via Virtual DOM"
    - "Progressive enhancement"

  status: "Phase E - Future implementation (most complex phase)"
