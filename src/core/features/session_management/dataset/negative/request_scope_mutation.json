  "design_note": "This is intentional Quantum design. Unlike ColdFusion where the request scope is mutable and often used for passing data between templates, Quantum enforces request scope as read-only. This prevents side effects and makes component behavior more predictable. Components should use q:set with local or session scope for mutable state, and treat request scope purely as an immutable source of HTTP request metadata."
