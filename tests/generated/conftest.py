"""
Conftest for generated tests.

These tests were auto-generated by Quantum Admin Test Generator but have
structural issues that need to be addressed:

1. Import paths are incorrect (quantum.runtime doesn't exist as package)
2. Functions are called without being imported
3. Test structure assumes Flask app context that isn't properly configured

These tests are temporarily skipped until the test generator is fixed.
